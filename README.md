# Map the Internet

## Description

I wanted to map the internet (websites) and show there connection to each other. This is a simple project that uses the networkx library to create a graph of websites and their connections. The graph is then visualized using the matplotlib library.

As this is my first python project, I don't expect anything to be actually good. I just wanted to try out python and see what I can do with it.

**Everything you currently see in this repo is WIP and not final.**

This project is inspired by the [The Internet Map](https://internet-map.net/), which is a beautiful visualization of the internet from 2011. I wanted to create something similar, but with a focus on the connections between websites and with up-to-date data.

## Where is the data?

Since everything right now is WIP, and a lot of things are not final, I don't want to share the data yet. I will share the data once I actually have something to show and know what kind of data I need.
Until then, you can generate your own data by running first the `setup.py` script (to configure the DB needed) and then the `worker.py` script (to start the data collection).

All the code is in the `src` folder.
